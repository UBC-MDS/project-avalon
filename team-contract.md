# Team Contract (Project-Avalon)

_Date: 2023-11-10_

## Expectations

The time expected for group members to work on DSCI 522 will be 8-10 hours per week/per person unless all the team members agree to lengthen the time expected. If team members cannot complete their sections within the maximum hours, members should give notice on Slack at least 24 hours before the group submission date (Saturday 6:00 am) to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.

All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all your functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.

## Meetings

Meeting times were established during the initial team meeting held on 2023-10-09. 

- Weekly Meetings:
   - The group will have a milestone kick-off meeting during the lab for 522 on Monday at 2:00 PM. All members are expected to attend the meetings.
   - Milestone finalization meetings to finalize the release will be held on Friday at 1:00 PM, via Google Meeting or in person (if it's a school day).
- Daily Virtual Stand-up:
   - Non-conditional:
      - Post daily work progress on Slack before 11:00 AM on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
   - Conditional but not optional:
      - Post daily work progress on Slack before 11:00 AM on Saturday and Sunday if the submission and milestone final review by the proofreader is not finished by Saturday, or in another case, the due is moved to Sunday.
   - Daily Post Content:
     - If you're unavailable to work on 522 for a day, it's OK to post `I'm available to work on the project today, due to....`. It's possible that you may have physical conditions, or no access to the internet or electronic devices for the next day's virtual stand-up. Just keep everyone posted.
     - If you're available to post anything on Slack. Please notify the other group members on Slack or in person in advance. Ghosting with no reason or advance notice will reflect on the [Team work reflection](https://www.gradescope.ca/courses/12442)

## Communication

All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github. GitHub will be the primary communication tool for ideas, and suggestions, submitting work, and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.

## Reviews

All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate. Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.

## Roles

There are two roles team members will be responsible for each week. The roles are as follows:
1. **Scribe**:
   - Responsible for taking notes at the meetings and in-class lab sessions and adding them as a GitHub issue.
   - Responsible for sharing all notes and in-class activities with teammates.
2. **Proof-reader**:
   - Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.

Positions will be rotated each week to ensure each team member does each position once.

## Deadlines

Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings and based on the project Kanban on GitHub. The proofreader will review the work on Saturday ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.

## Breach of Contract

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract required by the member.
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs about the issues with the teammate.
