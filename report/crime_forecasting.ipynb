    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, our focus revolved around constructing a time-series forecasting model tailored to predict crime incidents in Vancouver, using \"Month\" as the temporal unit. Our primary emphasis centered on one of the most prevalent crime types in Vancouver over the past two decades: theft from vehicles. We evaluated the efficacy of three fundamental forecasting modelsâ€”simple moving average, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA(1,1,0). Notably, the ARIMA(1,1,0) model emerged as the most effective, yielding a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of {glue:text}`arima_mae`. Considering that the occurrences of \"theft from a vehicle\" crimes per month often range in the hundreds to thousands, achieving a forecast performance of this caliber is notably commendable. It's worth highlighting that further refinement through comprehensive parameter tuning and integration of additional external variables holds the potential to cultivate even more accurate forecasting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the ARIMA(1,1,0) model's performance suggests promising potential for practical deployment in crime prevention strategies by law enforcement agencies. However, it's important to acknowledge the limitations inherent in solely relying on historical crime data; external socio-economic factors, seasonal fluctuations, and policy changes might significantly impact future crime trends, necessitating continual model adaptation and refinement for robust predictive accuracy."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle-related theft remains an ongoing concern nationwide in Canada, with statistics revealing a staggering incident of vehicle theft occurring every six minutes across the country {cite}`CTVnews`. This pervasive issue extends into Vancouver, presenting formidable challenges to both community safety and law enforcement efforts. Theft from vehicles, a prevalent form of this crime, significantly affects neighborhoods, inflicting distress and substantial financial losses on local residents. In response to this pressing concern, this project is dedicated to forecasting occurrences of theft from vehicles specifically within Vancouver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to forecast instances of theft from vehicles in Vancouver by analyzing historical data. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset sourced from the Vancouver Police Department, encompassing diverse crime records in Vancouver over the past {glue:text}`no_year_unique` years alongside incident locations, our goal is to construct a reliable predictive model. This model aims to anticipate the frequency and patterns specific to theft from vehicles. An accurate forecast holds the potential to empower the City of Vancouver to proactively allocate law enforcement resources, thereby curbing the occurrence of such crimes and enhancing community safety."

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset utilized for this project originates from the Vancouver Police Department, available through the following link: https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/ {cite}`crimedata2023`. It comprises {glue:text}`data_no_cols` columns/variables and encompasses a substantial volume of data, totaling {glue:text}`data_no_rows` rows. Each row corresponds to a distinct crime incident recorded within the dataset. The available information includes details about the crime type, the corresponding date of occurrence, and the specific location or neighborhood where the crime took place. These data points serve as crucial elements for our analysis and forecasting efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We're deploying three distinct time-series forecasting modelsâ€”Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Smoothing (ES), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). These models rely solely on the timestamp and the targeted forecasted value. Despite having location data, which holds potential value, we've deferred its utilization in this phase of the project. Employing a rolling window approach, we'll predict and assess model performance across a {glue:text}`no_year_unique`-year duration, setting the window size to 12 months. This configuration ensures that forecasts leverage the preceding year's data for accuracy. Specifically for ARIMA, the hyperparameters (p, d, q) are set at (1, 1, 0). This specification signifies that the model factors in the most recent lagged observations of the differenced series to predict the subsequent value. Our analysis was executed using Python, leveraging various libraries: numpy {cite}`harris2020`, Pandas {cite}`mckinney2010`, Altair {cite}`vanderplas2018`, scikit-learn {cite}`pedregosa`, Matplotlib {cite}`hunter2007`, Seaborn {cite}`seaborn`, and Statsmodels {cite}`seabold2010`."

However, since we are applying a pure time-series model that depend only on lagged values, the missing values shouldn't be an issue."

    "### Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), conspicuous anomalies surface in the dataset. The `HOUR` and `MINUTE` columns exhibit an unusual frequency of zero values, along with a disproportionate occurrence of '30' in the `MINUTE` column. Additionally, the `DAY` column prominently features an excessive number of records logged on the 31st of the month ({numref}`Figure {number} <numeric_dist>`). These irregularities likely stem from convenience in data recording, casting uncertainty on the accuracy of these three columns. In light of these inconsistencies, the most prudent approach is to exclude the `DAY`, `HOUR`, and `MINUTE` columns from analysis and focus solely on forecasting crime occurrences based on the `MONTH` variable. Moreover, from the two bar graphs displaying the distribution of `TYPE` and `NEIGHBORHOOD` ({numref}`Figure {number} <categ_dist>`), we get a good idea of the types of crime happening in Vancouver as well as the location in which they're concentrated in.

    "Finally, we'll compare the performances of the three models in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). Notably, there's a discernible pattern showcasing a marked enhancement in performance, progressing from Simple Moving Average (SMA) to Exponential Smoothing Approach (ESA) and ultimately to ARIMA. The final MAE achieved by the ARIMA model is {glue:text}`arima_mae`. Given that crime incidents per month often range in the hundreds to thousands, an MAE of {glue:text}`arima_mae` could be considered within an acceptable range, especially considering the complexities inherent in forecasting crime data. This consistent trend aligns with the observations gleaned from the visualizations crafted earlier, affirming the gradual improvement in forecasting accuracy across the models."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While the ARIMA model stands out as the most effective among the three forecasting modelsâ€”simple moving average and exponential smoothingâ€”it's crucial to acknowledge the room for enhancement in our predictive capabilities. Future advancements could entail fine-tuning the ARIMA hyperparameters or exploring alternative models to ascertain if further accuracy gains are attainable. Additionally, integrating exogenous variables, such as socioeconomic indicators or weather data, might augment the predictive power of our models, offering a more comprehensive understanding of crime dynamics. Furthermore, this analysis prompts future inquiries, including investigating the influence of specific external factors on crime occurrences or exploring spatial-temporal models to predict crime hotspots within Vancouver. These prospective avenues aim to refine our forecasting precision and deepen our insights into crime trends, paving the way for more informed law enforcement strategies and proactive crime prevention measures."
